The OpenO&M Web Service Common Interoperability Registry (ws-CIR) Specification provides a standards-based, vendor-neutral approach for the construction of an object registration server for a single facility, an entire enterprise, or multiple enterprises. The specification details an XML language and a set of Web Services which an OpenO&M ws-CIR Registry Server must support so that source client systems throughout an enterprise can harmonize and cross-reference their internal system objects. The server supports the harmonization of distinct, semantically-meaningful identifiers for the same tangible objects across multiple system by generating a non-semantically meaningful 128-bit OpenO&M Common Interoperability Registry ID (CIRID). The CIRID must be generated in compliance with the time-based generation mechanism of the Universal Unique IDentifier (UUID) definition found in ISO/IEC 9834-8:2005.

The CIRID is used only for harmonization between systems, so that each source system can continue to utilize their existing unique identifier for an identical object. In addition, the ws-CIR specification supports the harmonization of semantically identical properties from multiple systems associated with an object by generating a CIRID for each semantically identical property. This allows each source system to continue their existing unique identifier for a property.
