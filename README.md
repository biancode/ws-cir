# Common Interoperability Registry (CIR)

The OpenO&M Common Interoperability Registry Specification provides a standards-based, vendor-neutral approach for the construction of an object registration server for a single facility, an entire enterprise, or multiple enterprises. The specification details an XML language and a set of Web Services which an OpenO&M CIR Registry Server must support so that source client systems throughout an enterprise can harmonize and cross-reference their internal system objects. The server supports the harmonization of distinct, semantically-meaningful identifiers for the same tangible objects across multiple system by generating a non-semantically meaningful 128-bit OpenO&M Common Interoperability Registry ID (CIRID). The CIRID must be generated in compliance with the time-based generation mechanism of the Universal Unique IDentifier (UUID) definition found in ISO/IEC 9834-8:2005.
